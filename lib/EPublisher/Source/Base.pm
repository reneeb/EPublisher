=head1 HOW TO WRITE YOUR OWN SOURCE PLUGIN

It's fairly simple to write your own plugin. Basically it has to inherit from
this module and it has to provide the methods C<new> and C<load_source>.

C<new> has to return an object and C<load_source> has to return a list
of hashreferences where each reference should look like

  {
      pod => $pod_as_string,
      filename => $filename_of_documentation,
      title    => $a_title_for_documentation,
  }

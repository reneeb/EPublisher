# NAME

EPublisher - Publish documents in new format

# VERSION

version 1.25

# SYNOPSIS

    use EPublisher;
    
    my $yaml     = './test.yml';
    my @projects = qw(Test);
    
    my $deploy   = EPublisher->new;
    $deploy->config( $yaml );
    $deploy->run( \@projects );

The correspondend YAML file:

    ---
    Test:
      source:
        type: Module
        path: YAML::Tiny
      target:
        type: Text
        path: C:\anything\YAML_Tiny.txt

# DESCRIPTION

This tool aims to simplify publishing of documents, mainly POD. To be extendable, it
uses a simple plugin system. It uses YAML files for configuration (see [YAML::Tiny](https://metacpan.org/pod/YAML::Tiny))
and many CPAN modules for this task.

You can write your own plugins for your favourite source format
(see [EPublisher::Source::Base](https://metacpan.org/pod/EPublisher::Source::Base)) and/or a plugin for your favourite output format.

## Sources

"Sources" are input sources of the POD. In this base package there are three source
plugins:

- Dir

    Get all \*.pm and \*.pod files in the given directory and its subdirectories. See
    [EPublisher::Source::Plugin::Dir](https://metacpan.org/pod/EPublisher::Source::Plugin::Dir).

- File

    The Pod will be extracted from the given file.

- Module

    This tool will try to get the POD off the module (without loading the module).

[EPublisher::Source::Base](https://metacpan.org/pod/EPublisher::Source::Base) describes how you can write your own Source-Plugin.

## Targets

"Targets" are output formats. Currently there are two formats supported, but
other target plugins will follow.

- Text

    converts POD to plain text.

[EPublisher::Target::Base](https://metacpan.org/pod/EPublisher::Target::Base) describes how you can write your own Target-Plugin.

# METHODS

All methods available for EPublisher are described in the subsequent sections

## new

## config

## run

## deploy

## debug

# PSEUDO PROTOCOL

There is a small "pseudo" protocol for the debug messages:

    100 start running source
    101 stop running source (success)
    102 error
    
    200 start running target plugin
    201 stop running target plugin (success)
    202 error
    203 info from target plugin

# PREREQUESITS

[YAML::Tiny](https://metacpan.org/pod/YAML::Tiny), [Carp](https://metacpan.org/pod/Carp), [File::Spec](https://metacpan.org/pod/File::Spec), [File::Glob](https://metacpan.org/pod/File::Glob),



# Development

The distribution is contained in a Git repository, so simply clone the
repository

```
$ git clone http://github.com/reneeb/EPublisher.git
```

and change into the newly-created directory.

```
$ cd EPublisher
```

The project uses [`Dist::Zilla`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dist::Zilla) to
build the distribution, hence this will need to be installed before
continuing:

```
$ cpanm Dist::Zilla
```

To install the required prequisite packages, run the following set of
commands:

```
$ dzil authordeps --missing | cpanm
$ dzil listdeps --author --missing | cpanm
```

The distribution can be tested like so:

```
$ dzil test
```

To run the full set of tests (including author and release-process tests),
add the `--author` and `--release` options:

```
$ dzil test --author --release
```
